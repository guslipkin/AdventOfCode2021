# AdventOfCode2021



## Invite

I made a cute little invite poem for my friends at school:

> ‘Twas the night before Advent of Code, when all through the house
>
> Not a student was stirring, not even a mouse;
>
> The laptops were set on the table with care,
>
> In hopes that Eric Wastl soon would be there;
>
> The students were nestled all snug in their beds;
>
> While visions of programs danced through their heads;
>
> And Hail in her kerchief, and I in my cap,
>
> Had just settled our brains for a long winters nap,
>
> When out on the web there arose such a clatter,
>
> I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.
>
> Away to my laptop I sped like a light,
>
> Tore open the lid and threw up the site.
>
> The website came up with a soft inky glow,
>
> Gave a lustre of nighttime to objects below,
>
> When what to my wondering eyes did appear,
>
> But a set of instructions and a mission clear,
>
> With a little text input downloaded right quick,
>
> I sat nervously as time began to tick.
>
> More rapid than eagles my friends they came,
>
> And I whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:
>
> Now, *Austin*! now, *Melia* and *Melina*! now *Isabel* and *Jake*!
>
> On, *Antonio*! on, *Victoria*! on, *Nicole* and *Nate*!
>
> To your laptops! to the IDE of your choice!
>
> Now code away! Write away! Solve problems, rejoice!
>
> You’ll hear me exclaim, ere I code out of sight–
>
> *“Happy Advent of Code to all, and to all a good night!”*
